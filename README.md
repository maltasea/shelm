 # Buoy Multi-Backend Spec (Session Handoff)

  ## Normative Status

  - This README is a planning/handoff document and includes roadmap items.
  - The implemented language contract is `LANG_SPEC.md`.
  - Conformance checks are run via `scripts/check-conformance.sh`.
  - Latest conformance run summary is in `CONFORMANCE_REPORT.md`.
  - Newcomer docs: `docs/NEWCOMER_GUIDE.md` and `docs/welcome.html`.

  ## Summary

  Build Buoy as a single-host compiler with gradually added backends.
  First production backend after current work: Python, targeting semantic parity for core language + collections + regex (not full async/I/O initially).

  This spec is decision-complete for next implementation prompt.

  ## Scope and Goals

  ### In scope

  1. Stabilize compiler pipeline around canonical tuple AST stages:

  - Reader -> Parser -> Tuple AST -> Normalize -> Macro Expand -> Backend Codegen

  2. Keep current backends (perl, ocaml, go) compiling through unified pipeline.
  3. Implement Python backend v1 with parity for:

  - expressions, assignment, control flow, first-order functions
  - core containers currently modeled in AST ([], {}-mapped forms already representable)
  - string/array/hash builtins used by examples
  - regex literals and regex builtins

  4. Add backend conformance tests (shared source fixtures, expected outputs).

  ### Out of scope (this phase)

  - Full cross-platform compiler host support.
  - Full async/runtime parity in Python v1.
  - Full I/O builtin parity in Python v1.
  - Major language grammar rewrite beyond current reader+parser compatibility.

  ## Architectural Contract

  ### Compiler portability

  - Compiler host may remain single-host for now.

  ### Backend strategy

  - Add backends one-by-one; Python first.
  - Every backend uses normalized tuple AST, not direct surface syntax parsing.

  ### Canonical internal model

  - Tuple AST node shape remains canonical internally:
  - [tag, [char_pos, line_nr, module_name], args[]]
  - Existing Tuple_ast.node wrapper is authoritative.
  - Backend codegen receives expanded tuple AST (or validated adapter output).

  ## Public Interfaces / APIs

  ### lib/buoy.ml

  Maintain and use these APIs as primary:

  1. target_of_string : string -> (target, compile_error) result
  2. read_ast : ?module_name:string -> string -> (Tuple_ast.program, compile_error) result
  3. compile_ast : target -> Tuple_ast.program -> (string, compile_error) result
  4. compile_source_target : ?module_name:string -> string -> string -> (string, compile_error) result
  5. compile_file_target : string -> string -> (string, compile_error) result

  ### CLI

  - bin/buoy.ml remains thin wrapper over compile_file_target.
  - Target list will expand to include python when backend lands.

  ## Reader / Syntax Rules (current expected behavior)

  1. Line-based expressions normalize to call forms where applicable.
  2. Comma-separated call args supported:

  - printf "%s", concat ("ass", "hole")

  3. Keyword/end block syntax is canonical and enforced:

  - if cond then ... end
  - while cond do ... end
  - for x in xs do ... end
  - match x with | ... -> ... end
  - fn name ... do ... end

  4. Brace and colon block forms are rejected at reader level.
  5. Symbols allow - and ?.
  6. Regex shorthand #"...“ is intended language syntax (must not conflict with comment handling).

  ## Critical Fixes Required Before/With Python Backend

  1. Resolve # ambiguity:

  - #"...“, #[], #{} must not be consumed as comments.
  - Keep comment syntax without breaking new literals.

  2. Remove fragile generic ... do -> { rewrite:

  - only rewrite do in valid statement contexts (if/while/for/fn/else).

  3. Preserve/restore accurate source positions:

  - tuple AST metadata should use real parse positions.
  - error coordinates should map to user source (not rewritten-only offsets).

  ## Python Backend v1 Spec

  ### Output format

  - Default assumption: emit a single self-contained .py file (runtime helpers + program body).

  ### Runtime model

  Implement Python runtime helpers mirroring core semantic ops:

  - truthiness/coercion helpers
  - arithmetic/comparison ops with Buoy semantics
  - concat/index/index-assign
  - collection helpers (length/push/pop/shift/sort/reverse/keys/values/exists/delete/map/filter/each/join/split/substr/etc. as in v1 scope)
  - regex helpers

  ### Codegen pattern

  - Follow existing backend style: emit helper runtime first, then translated program.
  - Builtins dispatched explicitly in generator (like current Perl/OCaml/Go generators).
  - Unknown function calls compile to runtime call helper.

  ## Testing and Acceptance

  ### Conformance test suite

  Create shared tests run per backend (perl, ocaml, go, python once added):

  1. Arithmetic + precedence
  2. Conditionals (if/else if/else)
  3. Loops (while, for in)
  4. First-order functions + returns
  5. Collections (array/hash operations currently supported)
  6. String utilities
  7. Regex match/replace/find-all
  8. Reader syntax cases:

  - comma arg calls
  - paren grouping
  - braces blocks (canonical)
  - do/end blocks (compatibility)
  - dashed/question symbols
  - #"...“ literals

  ### Acceptance criteria

  - All existing examples compile via unified pipeline.
  - Python backend v1 passes conformance subset defined above.
  - No silent expression dropping due to comment/literal ambiguity.
  - Error messages remain structured and include source location metadata.

  ## Assumptions and Defaults

  1. Compiler host portability is deferred.
  2. Backend rollout is incremental; Python first.
  3. Python v1 includes core+collections+regex, excluding full async/I/O parity.
  4. Single-file Python output is the default packaging mode.
  5. Tuple AST remains canonical internal representation.

## Perl Host (Current)

Perl output now includes a small host bridge:

- `buoy_host_set(path, value)` registers a host value/function.
- `host_get(path)` resolves a host value.
- `host_call(path, args...)` resolves then invokes a host function.

If `BUOY_PERL_HOST` is set, generated Perl loads that file at startup (`do $ENV{BUOY_PERL_HOST}`), so host paths can be registered externally.

Default host file:

- `runtime/perl_host_default.pl`

It currently registers:

- `time/now_s`
- `time/now_ms`
- `math/add`

### Buoy host syntax

- `$foo/bar` rewrites to `host_get("foo/bar")`
- `&foo/bar(...)` rewrites to `host_call("foo/bar", ...)`

## Perl vs Buoy Timing Script

Use:

```bash
scripts/compare-perl-vs-buoy.sh \
  --perl examples/bench_sum.pl \
  --buoy examples/bench_sum.by \
  --iterations 50
```

With host file:

```bash
scripts/compare-perl-vs-buoy.sh \
  --perl path/to/reference.pl \
  --buoy path/to/equivalent.by \
  --host runtime/perl_host_default.pl \
  --iterations 50
```

CLI wrapper:

```bash
buoy path/to/equivalent.by \
  --benchmark path/to/reference.pl \
  --iterations 50 \
  --host runtime/perl_host_default.pl
```
